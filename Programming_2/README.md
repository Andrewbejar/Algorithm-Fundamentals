* Programming Paradigm
* A programming paradigm is simply a style of programming. Each paradigm varies depending on the specific needs of the programmer. 

## Classification of programing paradigms

# **Declarative** 

* Functional: (also, Applicative) Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.

* Data flow: (flow driven) Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.

* Logic, Constraint-based: (rule-based) Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions. 

* Template-based: Programming where  templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled

* Structured: programming with clean, nested control structures rather than via gotos. 

# **Imperative**

* Von Neuman:  is any of the programming languages that are high-level abstract isomorphic copies of von Neumann architectures.
* Interpreted(Scripting): intended to be very fast to learn and write in, either as short source code files or interactively in a  read–eval–print loop (REPL, language shell)
* Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects own their own internal state and public interfaces.  Object Orientation can be: class-bassed or prototype based.
